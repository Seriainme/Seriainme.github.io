[{"title":"The silent tambourine","path":"/posts/b4782ebe.html","content":"摘要内容 When I randomly tapped on ablo the other day ,a msg popped up informing me of the coming shutdown of the community in July.Had it not been for all the ridiculous things since covid, the bad news would be less trivial for me.After all with increasing number on business closures the result was not hard to see. {primary}(success Text) Dating back several years when I was rather active on SNS ,I had the first encounter with ablo when browsing Google Play Storen it hit on top ranking against other social networking apps tagging itself “making friends with ppl worldwide”.So I downloaded it intending to receive free oral English practice, which later proved to be a bad idea since most users speak spanish n other languages:) Elise was one of them.Her mother language was French.We both sucked at English, yet it was the only common language share. In a senior high school of a small town near Paris she picked up English lessons .But she found it hard n did not do well in it. Back then she was preparing for Le baccalauréat n went through quite lot pressure every day.She told me that the Philosophy exam would go on for 4 hours n it could not be worse.She would often get home crying in schooldays. I dunno y.Perhaps it is not sadness or pressure that I feel. I could not tell or help it:( .Sry for seeing me like this.It is so embarrassing. Elise: I dunno y.Perhaps it is not sadness or pressure that I feel.I could not tell or help it:( .Sry for seeing me like this.It is so embarrassing. me: Don’t worry.I feel u there.I wish I can make u feel better. I remembered the tears dripping down her apple-like cheeks like unexpected raindrop.She did not seem sad tho. Then I offered her some advice that I had applied to. Several years later I got to step into her shoes more when I started working with 996 system. I almost could not breathe with heavy pressure n workload. My brain was still well functioning, but it needed to release the poisonous stuff produced by pressure with tears. So I could not help crying every Saturday morning on the way to work or late 10 pm in the company.And I would be reminded of her “This must be what Elise felt like.I wish she’s been through now” Other issues had been dragging her down as well .Fed up with family ties her dad evaporated himself in her adolescence time. Her mom had to support the family on her own. “Cases of men abandoning their family r not rare in France. They got tired of family issues n they just run away .” I guessed her family were not living a rich life.One time when I was showing my pet turtle crawling on the marble flooring ,she felt very surprised about the floor n said it was coooooooool.Another time I showed her the tall residential buildings in my community she felt quite astonished stating that she had not seen houses like that in her village. She had a noisy younger brother .When they talk in French,it felt like they were quarreling ,yelling to each other. “y r guys talking so loooooooud?😫 I don’t get it. in China talking like that high volume would be considered offensive tho “ “Oh really ?but how do u let go your bad feelings n emotion then?I mean, if u keep suppressing yourself ,it would be bad for you” Her words enlightened me with new perspective of life .y for the whole time repression n silence had been considered good virtues in China?Ppl never wanted others to know too much about their feelings.That was way bad to go. I could not recall many deatails now .Her look in my memory has turned into a vague image of a white girl with short blone hair n lovely freckles .Her home was a small house in the village.She took bus every day to school.She was very beautiful from my POV but she told me that the boys in school had been teasing her at her look n weight . “y do ppl have to care so much about look n body of girls ? “ “I feel so sorry for what u have been through .but it is not your fault ,it is them who should be blamed .you’re a pretty girl for sure don’t care about the dummyheads” “but it is not all their fault .they r just following their basic instinct to get rid of bad gene which usually results in rather normal look.Evolution psychology would solve some of ur puzzles I suppose.” I used to hold the sterotype that French ppl r romantic n wanted to go to Paris someday till I told Elise about it.She felt very confused . “Parisian r hella rude n arrogant in general n they r hella loud.I don’t think romance has anything to do with them lol.” She did not like reading but she knew about writers like La Parure，Rousseau，Patrick Modiano.When I told her about the reading I had done about these writers ,she was very surprised n praised me with the word “well-cultivated”.I still remember the word so far.
